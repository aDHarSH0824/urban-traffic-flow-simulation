# Urban Traffic Flow Simulation & Congestion Risk Analyzer

## Overview
This project simulates urban traffic flow dynamics using discrete-time modeling to analyze congestion buildup and risk under varying traffic density and disruption scenarios.

## Problem Statement
Urban road networks often experience congestion due to high traffic volume, limited capacity, and unexpected disruptions. Understanding how congestion builds over time is essential for traffic planning and risk mitigation.

## Solution
The system models vehicle inflow and outflow on road segments, tracks queue formation, and computes congestion risk levels based on traffic density and capacity constraints. The results are visualized to highlight congestion trends and high-risk conditions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Status
Project under active development.
